  "text": "Sometimes I wonder if people even notice when I slowly pull away — not out of anger, but out of quiet exhaustion. I stop replying as fast, stop initiating plans, stop showing up like I used to. And the silence that follows? That’s what confirms it. They didn’t really care. They just liked the version of me that was always available, always giving. But the moment I stopped pouring from an empty cup, they disappeared too.",
